# LINQ, Delegates and Events ðŸ¥§

## LINQ ðŸ”¹

As we know LINQ ( Language Integrated Query ) is a dynamic and advanced syntax for retrieving information. With a combination of the right LINQ methods, we can create complex queries ( specific requests ) that retrieve basically any combination of business logic that we would ever need. We create these combinations by chaining LINQ methods. Most of the methods return specific values on which we need to chain the other methods. We can't just chain any method, so that is why we must always be aware of the return value of the previous method before we write a new one. Methods that return a collection, always return it as an IEnumerable type, which is the base interface from which all generic collections inherit. Since it is the base, we can convert the result from LINQ methods that return multiple items into whatever we need it to be. Usually, we call the .ToList() method to convert the IEnumerable into List. Some methods return a single item or a single type that is not the same as the original type of our collection, so we have to treat it as such. Writing queries can also be done in two ways: SQL-like syntax and Lambda expressions. In the first examples, there will be code for both of them, but since lambda expressions are more widely used, we will continue working with that for the rest of the examples.

### Setup

```csharp
public class Student
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
    public bool IsPartTime { get; set; }
    public List<Subject> Subjects { get; set; }
    public Student()
    {

    }
    public Student(int id, string first, string last, int age, bool partTime)
    {
        Id = id;
        FirstName = first;
        LastName = last;
        Age = age;
        IsPartTime = partTime;
    }
}

public class Subject
{
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public int Modules { get; set; }
    public int StudentsAttending { get; set; }
    public Academy Type { get; set; }

    public Subject(int id, string title, int modules, int students, Academy type)
    {
        Id = id;
        Title = title;
        Modules = modules;
        StudentsAttending = students;
        Type = type;
    }
}

public enum Academy
{
    Programming,
    Design,
    Networks
}

public static class SEDC
{
    public static List<Student> Students = new List<Student>()
    {
        new Student(12, "Bob", "Bobsky", 29, false),
        new Student(22, "Jill", "Wayne", 36, true),
        new Student(27, "Greg", "Gregsky", 45, false),
        new Student(29, "Anne", "Willson", 31, true),
        new Student(30, "Liana", "Wurtz", 25, false),
        new Student(41, "Bill", "Zu", 38, false)
    };
    public static List<Subject> Subjects = new List<Subject>()
    {
        new Subject(15, "C# Basic", 10, 24, Academy.Programming ),
        new Subject(16,"C# Advanced", 15, 26, Academy.Programming ),
        new Subject(44, "JavaScript", 25, 22, Academy.Programming ),
        new Subject(67, "Photoshop", 12, 18, Academy.Design ),
        new Subject(88, "Illustrator", 12, 18, Academy.Design ),
        new Subject(97,"Networks Basic", 8, 12, Academy.Networks ),
        new Subject(98, "Networks Advanced", 16, 10, Academy.Networks )
    };
    static SEDC()
    {
        Students[0].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[0], Subjects[2], Subjects[3], Subjects[4] };
        Students[1].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[3], Subjects[4], Subjects[5], Subjects[1] };
        Students[2].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[5], Subjects[6] };
        Students[3].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[3], Subjects[4] };
        Students[4].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[1], Subjects[2], Subjects[3], Subjects[5] };
        Students[5].Subjects = new List<Subject>() { Subjects[2] };
    }
}
```

### Where

- Where filters items by an expression that must be true or false
- Where always returns IEnumerable of the same type as the target collection

```csharp
// SQL Like
IEnumerable<Student> findBobsSql = from x in SEDC.Students
                                   where x.FirstName == "Bob"
                                   select x;
// Lambda Expression
IEnumerable<Student> findBobsLambda = SEDC.Students
.Where(x => x.FirstName == "Bob");
```

### Select

- Select creates a collection with a different form of the initial collection by an expression that can be any value
- Select returns IEnumerable with the type of the value in the expression

```csharp
// SQL Like
List<string> firstNamesSql = (from x in SEDC.Students
  select x.FirstName).ToList();
List<string> studentFullNamesSql = (from x in SEDC.Students
  select $"{x.FirstName} {x.LastName}").ToList();
// Lambda Expression
List<string> firstNamesLambda = SEDC.Students
.Select(x => x.FirstName).ToList();
List<string> studentFullNamesLambda = SEDC.Students
.Select(x => $"{x.FirstName} {x.LastName}").ToList();
```

### Complex query

- We can write a LINQ query inside another LINQ query as long as the inner query is part of an expression that follows the rules of the LINQ query in which it is called in
- For example, if we have Where(), in it we can create another LINQ expression as long as the whole thing returns true or false at the end
- Large chains can be closed with brackets so that a new method can be called on the whole result

```csharp
// SQL Like
List<Student> ptProgrSqlQuery = (from x in SEDC.Students
                                 where x.IsPartTime
                                 where (from y in x.Subjects
                                        where y.Type == Academy.Programming
                                        select y).ToList().Count != 0
                                 select x).ToList();
// Lambda Expression
List<Student> ptProgrLambdaQuery = SEDC.Students.Where(x => x.IsPartTime)
.Where(x => x.Subjects
    .Where(y => y.Type == Academy.Programming)
.ToList().Count != 0)
.ToList();
```

### First / FirstOrDefault

- First tries to get the first item from a collection. If it fails it throws an exception
- FirstOrDefault tries to get the first item from a collection. If it fails it returns a default value ( null for objects )
- We can write an expression inside of these methods to create a filter and then on the filtered result, First or FirstOrDefault to be called

```csharp
Student student1 = SEDC.Students.First();
Student student2 = SEDC.Students.FirstOrDefault();
Student student3 = SEDC.Students.First(x => x.Name == "Bob");
Student student4 = SEDC.Students.FirstOrDefault(x => x.Name == "Bob");
```

### Last/ LastOrDefault

- Last tries to get the last item from a collection. If it fails it throws an exception
- LastOrDefault tries to get the last item from a collection. If it fails it returns a default value ( null for objects )
- We can write an expression inside of these methods to create a filter and then on the filtered result, Last or LastOrDefault to is called

```csharp
Student student1 = SEDC.Students.Last();
Student student2 = SEDC.Students.LastOrDefault();
Student student3 = SEDC.Students.Last(x => x.Name == "Bob");
Student student4 = SEDC.Students.LastOrDefault(x => x.Name == "Bob");
```

### Single/ SingleOrDefault

- Single tries to get one item from a collection. If it fails OR if there are multiple items as a result, it throws an exception
- LastOrDefault tries to get one item from a collection. If it fails it returns a default value ( null for objects ) BUT if there are multiple items as a result, it throws an exception
- We can write an expression inside of these methods to create a filter and then on the filtered result, Single or SingleOrDefault to be called

```csharp
Student student1 = SEDC.Students.Single();
Student student2 = SEDC.Students.SingleOrDefault();
Student student3 = SEDC.Students.Single(x => x.Name == "Bob");
Student student4 = SEDC.Students.SingleOrDefault(x => x.Name == "Bob");
```

### SelectMany

- Flattens a Collection of collections ( Takes all items from all collections and adds them in one collection instead of the items being in separate collections )
- Returns IEnumerable of the type from all the collections inside the main collection

```csharp
// The issue with Select when working with Collection properties
// We have a list of lists and that is hard to work with
List<List<Subject>> partTimeSubjectsSelect = SEDC.Students
.Where(x => x.IsPartTime)
.Select(x => x.Subjects).ToList();
// Merging the lists together
List<Subject> partTimeSubjectsMany = SEDC.Students
.Where(x => x.IsPartTime)
.SelectMany(x => x.Subjects).ToList();
```

### Distinct

- Removes all duplicate values from a collection
- Returns IEnumerable of the same type as the original collection

```csharp
List<Subject> distinctSubjects = partTimeSubjectsMany.Distinct().ToList();
```

### Any

- Checks if there is at least one item in a collection that follows an expression
- Returns true or false depending on the result

```csharp
bool isBob = SEDC.Students
.Any(x => x.FirstName == "Bob");
```

### All

- Checks if all items of a collection follow a particular expression
- Returns true or false depending on the result

```csharp
bool areThereShortNames = SEDC.Students
.All(x => x.FirstName.Length >= 3);
```

### Except

- Creates a new collection that is missing some particular items
- It returns IEnumerable of the same type as the original collection

```csharp
List<Student> exceptPartTime = SEDC.Students
.Except(SEDC.Students.Where(x => x.IsPartTime)).ToList();
```

### OrderBy / ThenBy

- Orders a collection by a given value
- Can order by ascending - OrderBy and descending - OrderByDescending
- Can have multiple levels of ordering with the ThenBy and ThenByDescending methods
- Returns IEnumerable of the same type as the original collection

```csharp
List<Student> sortedStudents = SEDC.Students
.OrderBy(x => x.FirstName).ToList();
List<Student> sortedStudentsDesc = SEDC.Students
.OrderByDescending(x => x.FirstName).ToList();
List<Student> sortedStudentsThen = SEDC.Students
.OrderBy(x => x.FirstName).ThenBy(x => x.Age).ThenBy(x => x.Id).ToList();
```

## Delegates ðŸ”¹

Values in C# always have a certain type. Just as values can be represented by a type, so can methods. Delegates are types that represent references to methods. If the method and the delegate share the same signature ( Return and parameter types ) then the delegate can be instantiated with a method that meets the requirements. This means that we can use Delegates as types for methods in a code block, but also as a parameter to a method, creating a higher-order method. In a delegate, a method can be passed as an argument and the result stored as well as a lambda expression. These methods can then be passed to any other place of the type of the delegate, even if they have a different implementation.

### Delegates in Action

```csharp
// Declaring a delegate
public delegate void SayDelegate(string something);

public static void SayHello(string person)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Hello {person}!");
}
public static void SayBye(string person)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Bye {person}!");
}

SayDelegate del = new SayDelegate(SayHello); // The SayDelegate points to SayHello
SayDelegate bye = new SayDelegate(SayBye); // The SayDelegate points to SayBye
SayDelegate wow = new SayDelegate(x => Console.WriteLine($"Wow {x}!")); // The SayDelegate points to an anonymous method

// Using the delegate ( Points to methods )
del("Bob");
bye("Jill");
wow("Greg");
```

#### Delegates as parameters

```csharp
public delegate int NumbersDelegate(int num1, int num2);

public static void SayWhatever(string whatever, SayDelegate sayDel)
{
  Console.Write("Chatbot says:");
  sayDel(whatever);
}
SayWhatever("Bob", SayHello);
SayWhatever("Jill", SayBye);
SayWhatever("Greg", x => Console.WriteLine($"Wow {x}!"));
SayWhatever("Anne", x =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Stuff with {x}");
    Console.WriteLine($"Other stuff with {x}");

public static void NumberMaster(int num1, int num2, NumbersDelegate numberDel)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"The result is: {numberDel(num1, num2)}");
}

NumberMaster(2, 5, (x, y) => x + y);
NumberMaster(2, 5, (x, y) => x - y);
NumberMaster(2, 5, (x, y) => 0);
NumberMaster(2, 5, (x, y) =>
{
    if (x > y) return x;
    return y;
});
});
```

## Events ðŸ”¹

Events are entities that we can use to notify multiple classes or objects when something happens. When the thing happens when we can even send data. Events request a delegate as a type, so that methods that want to follow that action which the event would raise, can just subscribe to that event and get it at the moment the execution. Events are widely used for communication between systems as well as building windows forms.

## Publisher/Subscriber model ðŸ”¹

The publisher-subscriber model is a great way to send information to all that want to listen to get particular information when something happens. This system works by creating a Publisher and Subscriber class. The Publisher class needs to take care of the event/events that will accumulate a method that needs to be called when something happens. This publisher class should also have delegates that can be used for the events, and some methods for basic functionality, that implement and call the subscribe method. Subscribers can at any time add a method that matches the event delegate or remove one so that when the Publisher sends their info, just the people that subscribed and left their method in the event will get the message.

### Publisher

```csharp
public class Publisher
{
  public delegate void DataProcessingDelegate(string message);
  public event DataProcessingDelegate DataProcessingHandler;
  public void ProcessData(string message) // business logic
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Processing data...");
    Thread.Sleep(3000); // zavrsuva rabota! mnogu e tesko! 3 sekundi!
    WhenDataIsProcessed(message);
  }
  // It notifies all subscribers of the message that is processed from the ProcessData method
  protected void WhenDataIsProcessed(string message)
  {
    if (DataProcessingHandler != null)
    {
      DataProcessingHandler(message);
    }
  }
}
```

### Subscribers

```csharp
public class Subscriber1
{
    public void GetMessage(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Subscriber 1 here!");
        Console.WriteLine("YAY I GOT MY MESSAGE!");
        Console.WriteLine($"THE MESSAGE IS: {message}");
    }
    public string GetMessageFAIL(int num)
    {
        return "This will FAIL!";
    }
}

public class Subscriber2
{
    public void GetMessage(string message)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
        Console.WriteLine("Subscriber 2 here!");
        Console.WriteLine("I AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH THE MESSAGE!");
        Console.WriteLine($"THE MESSAGE IS: {message}");
    }
}
```

### Using the model

```csharp
string fancyMessage = "This is a very fancy message!";
Publisher publisher = new Publisher();
Subscriber1 sub1 = new Subscriber1();
Subscriber2 sub2 = new Subscriber2();

publisher.DataProcessingHandler += sub1.GetMessage;
publisher.DataProcessingHandler += sub2.GetMessage;
publisher.DataProcessingHandler += x =>
Console.WriteLine($"Special handling of message: {x}");

publisher.ProcessData(fancyMessage);
Thread.Sleep(3000);
publisher.DataProcessingHandler -= sub2.GetMessage;
publisher.ProcessData("NOVA PORAKA");
Console.ReadLine();
```
