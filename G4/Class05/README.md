## Class05 - Workshop - Simple Taxi Application

A proposed skeleton for the application that we started building during our first workshop class for this course. Already has most of the implementation in place, and tries to use all of the topics that we went through so far (abstract classes, interfaces, static classes/members, polymorphism, generics and extension methods). Some methods needs to be implemented - try to search for methods that throw `NotImplementedException`. Implementation might not be perfect though, but should give you a general idea on how to structure things - if you find anything let me know and I will correct it.

Try to think of some edge cases that are not covered (e.g. whitespaces when entering userName/password) and let's discuss during next class.
